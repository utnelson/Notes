# Impi

In this article, we will describe the functional approach and various usage options for IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface). IPMI is a series of specifications that provide standardized interfaces to the so-called “platform management” services. In this context, the term “Platform Management” refers to monitoring hardware (system temperatures, fans, power supplies and so forth), their control (booting and shutting down the server) and the documentation (logging) of “out-of-range” states. IPMI was developed by Intel, Hewlett Packard, NEC and Dell.
